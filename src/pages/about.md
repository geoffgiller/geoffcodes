**I am Front-End Developer** from Norwalk, CT. After graduating from Sacred Heart University with a degree in Computer Science, I've been working hard to improve as both a developer and human.

> If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away. <cite>Henry David Thoreau</cite>

My interests span a wide variety of mediums, including web development, songwriting, writing screenplays and stand-up comedy. It is extremely important to me that the work I do can contribute to the world in a way that brings meaning to my life and the lives of others.
